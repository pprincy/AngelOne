          <h5 class="sec-ttl">Introduction</h5>
          <p>Investment in securities is susceptible to market risks which cannot be predicted. The Account Opening Document contains an explanation of different types of risks our Customers are likely to face in the market. While the risk of loss is inherent in the market, we as your Broker seek to minimize the risk of loss through a dynamic risk management policy which is an essential feature of our operations. As our customer, it is important for you to be aware of our Risk Management Policy and how the Policy would operate to regulate your transactions. It is also important that the Risk Management Policy is not an insurance against losses; these are measures and precautions that are adopted to contain risks to the minimum. The Policy is subject to change according to our risk perceptions of the market and SEBI/Exchange regulations for the time being in force.</p>

          <h5 class="sec-ttl">Scrip Categorization</h5>
          <p>For the purpose of risk management, we categorize Scrips listed on NSE and BSE as “Blue Chip”, “Good”, “Average” or “Poor” on the basis of their fundamentals, volatility, liquidity, trading pattern and overall concentration with individual customers. These categorizations form the basis for defining hair-cut on collateral, providing exposure limits, impose trading restrictions, calculate projected risk, prioritize collection, control exchange surveillance related risk, etc.</p>

      <p>
          Margin/Deposit based limits are assigned to the customers for trading purpose. VaR/SPAN margin
          specified by the exchanges is blocked at scrip level on the positions taken by the clients during the
          day.

              <strong>Deposit calculation:</strong> Deposit is calculated at customer level after netting off ledger balance in all
              segments and Holding lying in Angel. Margin is calculated as follows:
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Margin = Ledger Balance (Dr/Cr) + Net value after haircut of holding &amp; margin pledge available with Angel.</strong>

              <strong>Valuation of holding &amp; margin pledge:</strong> Holding &amp; margin pledge valuation is done on previous
              day’s closing price. Net valuation is calculated by applying appropriate haircut based on VaR margin
              percentage specified by the exchanges or Angel prescribed rates, as the case may be.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Extreme market conditions: Limits are assigned</strong> based on credit in the ledger. In such

              <strong>Single order quantity and value cap:</strong> In order to minimize loss from possible punching errors by
              a dealer while executing the transaction for a customer, Risk Management of Angel puts restriction
              by capping the maximum quantity and value per order and orders exceeding that maximum quantity
              or value cap will be rejected. Angel also sets terminal level limits to contain loss from erroneous
              trades getting executed. Angel shall not assume any liability in respect of orders rejected by reason of
              their quantity or value exceeding the cap value.

                  whichever is higher) in order to avoid the projected square off. If the same is not maintained, the client
                  would be qualified for a projected Risk square off and an intimation would be triggered – Client would

                  In case of extreme volatility in the market, Angel may demand payment of margin forthwith and prescribed

                  volatility shall be final and binding without Angel having to provide any reason for the decision to the Client
                  In case there is a shortfall, margin call would be made on T day itself – In the normal market condition, it is

                  Square off will be done on LIFO basis, last settled shares from poor to blue-chip category will be considered for

              <p>
                  For a client who has opted for MTF and trades in scrips which are un approved (not part of Group 1 securities)
                  , the outstanding debits will have to be cleared within T + 6 days failing which the aged debit more than the

              <p>
                  Of the above square offs, the priority of the square off would be given to projected risk. At a client level

              <p>
                  <strong>Intraday</strong> product is designed for higher market exposure to Clients in Equity Cash /Derivatives / Currency and
                  Commodity markets, against a given investment. This product is suitable to Clients who are keen to make most out of
                  favorable market movement from a given investment. The product allows the Client market exposure several times
                  more than what would otherwise be possible in the normal order types with a given amount as margin. Intraday
                  products are opened for the day and squared off the same day, following certain pre-defined logic.
              </p>
              <span class="sec-ttl lowerCase">How it works (Example):</span>
              <p>
                  In a regular margin based trading scenario, on Rs. 18,000/- as margin in the derivative segment, a Client would be
                  able to take one NIFTY, if one NIFTY is Rs. 2 lakh and the margin required is 9%. By opting for our Intraday
                  product, against the same amount of Rs. 18,000/- a Client can obtain as many as 6 NIFTY contracts, which would
                  mean 6 times higher return on the same investment.

              <span class="sec-ttl lowerCase">Benefit of limit multiplier:</span>
              <p>
                  Clients have the option of choosing the number of times higher exposure (multiplier) is required by them subject to
                  the maximum multiplier limit prescribed for the segment.

                  The margin blocked against a unit of INTRADAY position is a reduced amount proportionally inverse to the limit

                  the margin that would be required for the same exposure in a normal trade.

                  However, if the market loss on “Intraday” positions reaches 80% (the trigger) of the total funds (cash and cash
                  equivalent of collateral securities as adjusted to hair cut) available, the “INTRADAY” positions would be closed out as
                  soon as the trigger is reached. In this case, all open positions across all segments, i.e., including positions other than
                  Intraday positions, will also get squared off simultaneously. The Risk Management System of Angel (RMS) will
                  constantly monitor the “Intraday” positions for the Clients and close them out accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                  After the positions are squared off, whether time-based or trigger based, no fresh Intraday positions would be
                  allowed for the day and all pending orders would be cancelled. Clients have the option of squaring off the
                  Intraday positions any time before they are squared off as per the above pre-defined logic. They will also have the option to convert INTRADAY positions before they are squared
                  off into CARRYFORWARD positions as explained below.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Angel will notify the Clients through SMS and/or emails, if the Intraday positions incur MtoM loss. SMS intimation
                  would be sent when the MtoM loss is at 50%, 70% and 80% of the total funds (cash and cash equivalent of collateral
                  securities as adjusted to hair cut) in the Client account. Client may make payment online (net transfer) to replenish
                  funds so that compulsory square off trigger is not activated which shall be across positions in all segments.

                      <p>
                          Intraday Product is an intraday order facility, wherein client’s orders are squared off the same day following certain
                          pre-defined logic. The margins blocked against Intraday product would be a reduced amount depending upon the
                          limit multiplier. Higher the limit multiplier, proportionally lower would be the per unit margin for the positions
                          contracted. The Intraday position is monitored by Angel RMS and squared off on T day, which shall be either time
                          based or as the case may be trigger based, whichever event occurs first.

                      <p>
                          When the intraday positions are squared off at the trigger (i.e., when MtoM loss equals or exceeds 80% of the total
                          funds (cash and cash equivalent as adjusted to hair cut), all open market positions,
                          across all segments, whether in the same scrip or not, get squared off automatically. Except in this situation, positions
                          other than Intraday positions would not be affected; they would be maintained subject to availability of margin as per
                          the margin norms unless the Client initiates square off. It is further clarified that if and when available funds (cash
                          and cash equivalents) are eroded by 80% due
                          to MtoM in any positions, not necessarily Intraday positions, all open interests, including carry forwards shall be auto
                          squared off, following auto square off auto square off policy.
